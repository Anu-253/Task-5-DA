# 🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## 🔎 Overview
This project is part of a **Data Analyst Internship (Task 5)** focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
The main objective is to extract insights from the Titanic dataset using both **visual** and **statistical exploration**.  
Through this, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that provide a deeper understanding of the data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform descriptive analysis using `pandas` functions (`.describe()`, `.info()`, `.value_counts()`).
- Visualize relationships and distributions with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Identify significant trends and correlations.
- Provide clear observations for each visualization.
- Summarize findings in a concise manner.
